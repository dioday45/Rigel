## Tutorial

When the program is started, a menu appears allowing you to either start the simulation or
access project details (Sources, credits and authors).
If you click on the "infos" button, the details page will be displayed. To return to the menu
To start the simulation, simply click on the "back" button and start the simulation.

To start the simulation, you can click on the "Start the simulation" button of the menu
of start-up.

Once the simulation window is launched, several modifications are possible.
For example, you can change :
    - The longitude and latitude.
    - The date.
    - The time.
    - Time zone.
    - The type of acceleration (time acceleration).
    - Toggle to full screen mode or exit from full screen mode

You can then press the "play" button to launch the simulation and see the advanced sky map.
with time or "pause" to stop it. The "reset" button resets the simulation.

The program contains two types of acceleration (continuous and discrete), the first one allows to simply
multiply by 1x, 30x, 300x or 3000x the normal time sequence, while the discrete type allows for
to advance the time either by intervals of 24 hours (the animation is done day by day at the same time)
either by interval 23h 56min and 4s, otherwise called "sidereal day" which corresponds to the exact time that the Earth
puts to do a trick on herself. This last acceleration thus makes it possible to see only the stars of the
solar system move around the Earth while the stars remain fixed.

A first drop-down menu allows you to select one of the planet's capitals and thus change automatically.
longitude and latitude to match the selected location.

A second drop-down menu allows you to center the view on a chosen star (if possible).
It is then possible to click on this star which will display some information about it.
To leave this display, you just have to click on another place of the simulation window.

Good simulation :)


This is a first year school project based on the book
"Practical Astronomy with your Computer or Spreadsheet" from Peter Duffett-Smith and Jonathan Zwart.
